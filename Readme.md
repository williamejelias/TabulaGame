# Tabula Game

Implementation of the Roman game of Tabula as part of year 1 of my Masters Degree course in Computer Science.

## Usage

Clone the repository, compile the Java source, and run the main method of the Game Class to start a new game.

Games can be played between two human, or computer players, using a command line text interface, and a very basic GUI is also provided (minimal functionality).
